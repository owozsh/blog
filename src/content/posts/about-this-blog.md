### Why did I start this blog?

I believe that writing is a good way to organize your thoughts and preserve them through time.

Who knows, having these thoughts recorded might be useful someday.

### How was this blog developed?

I've tried a lot of tools before coming to a definitive solution (_NextJS_, _Phoenix_, _Hugo_, ...).

Comparing them may be a good topic for another post, but I decided to stick with _Astro_ for its good out of the box
markdown support, collection structure and tailwind support.

I'm really satisfied with it and I would strongly recommend using it if you're thinking of starting a blog yourself.
