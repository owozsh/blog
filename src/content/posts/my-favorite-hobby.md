I've tried a lot of hobbies in the last 10 years, including:

- Piano
- YouTube Channel ~~yes, my minecraft channel~~
- Motion Graphics
- 3D Modeling
- Aikido
- Acting
- Hip Hop
- Ballet
- and so on...

But there's one hobby that I love so much that I need to write about it.

Learning a new language.

From all the hobbies I've listed above, this is definately the most rewarding one. I can't stress enough how important knowing english was for everything I know today or how much fun I had studying japanese and korean.

The moment that I've noticed this, was when I was listening to **For Lovers** by **Lamp**, a really soft song by a really cool japanese band, and I've always listened to it unaware of its meaning. Some random day, I was listening to it again, but, this time, very closely, and I could understand the last verse for the first time, I got touched by it, and what a beautiful ending.

No other hobby could leed to this experience.
