### Things I dislike about Hey

- Selection is not how we're used to
  - there's no `Ctrl` shortcut for selecting specific items from a list
  - there's no `Shift` shortcut for selecting a range of items from a list
  - you can't select items in the trash

### Things I love about Hey

- Keyboard shortcuts for everything
