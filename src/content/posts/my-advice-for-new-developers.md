How do I start? Am I doing this right? Why can't I get a job? Maybe this is not for me.

I've been a teacher assistant at my university for about two years, and I got the chance to
meet a lot of young people trying to join the club. Most of them share the same complaints,
difficulties and habits that may leed them to a hard time getting into the market.

In this post I'll share some advice that I'd give to my younger self, and I hope this helps begginers somehow.

## How to Get a Job

A while ago, I helped interviewing some people for a position at my previous job and it gave me a really good
idea of what interviewers expect of you.

Of course this will be different depending on your country, the job you're applying to, and, of course, the company and its recruiter.

First of all, what I **DON'T** expect you to have

- Tons of experience
- A list of languages/frameworks/tools you know ~~just listing it makes no sense to be honest~~
- An extensive resume with tons of side projects, open source contributions and hackatons

If an organization just asks you for years of experience and a checklist of things you should know, it's probably not a good
opportunity.

So, what do will I look for?

- You **listen** to other people
- You know how to **explain** your ideas
- You take **responsability** for the work you do
- You have **autonomy** for learning, debugging and knows when to ask
- You have a good **sense of importance**

Notice that the main thing being evaluated is whether you are able to receive a task, truly understand what that
task is and its value to the product, complete it by a deadline (and communicating if something goes wrong along the way) and take responsibility if
any problems occur.

I'd also recommend talking with people. If you want to join some company, try getting in contact with a recruiter or even a
developer that works there, it's pretty easy these days with LinkedIn, you may receive some tips, skip the line or even get a call months later.

Yes, if you can, get a diploma. It's not easy getting to the interview step, so make sure your resume is at least
above average.

## How to Learn

### Concepts:

Yes, you should learn data structures, algorithms and stuff.

I know some people don't like it, but it's important, very important.

So make sure to read your books, practice your leetcode. Believe it or not, this improves your problem solving skills and
helps understanding how the tools you use and the things around you work.

So, put it on your schedule: sit, study and practice until it hurts.

### Tools:

_Read_

_the_

_damn_

_documentation_

Always remember, a board game always come with a manual because its creator wants people to play it.
If you want to play with a new tool, read its manual.

But let's agree that no one wants to sit and read the whole documentation all day, that's why we now need a side project.

So pick one topic you're interested in, it can be a recipe manager, a cool game, or even a simple wiki. Just make sure
this project will help you reach your goals, and try to keep it simple, unless you're trying to be the next ConcernedApe.

Don't forget, at the end of the day, you don't build to learn, you learn to build.

## Bonus: owozsh tech tips

- learn how to debug
- **NEVER** repeat code ~ read about [DRY (extracted from the book _The Pragmatic Programmer_)](https://media.pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/dry.pdf)
- learn how to name things
- learn how to debug
- if you're _ifelsing ifelsing ifelsing_ there's something wrong
- if your class, module or name it have tons of public functions there's something wrong as well
- learn how to debug
- tests are your friends
- avoid complexity at all costs unless you absolutely need good performance

**I'm serious, learn how to debug** ðŸ”ª
